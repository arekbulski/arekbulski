              <p><b>Viper experience</b> was our final year project at university. I was the lead designer with 2 more people working on it. It is an action game, a space fighter simulator. If you have ever watched some episodes of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica and were impressed by action packed scenes, then you can imagine what I tried to achieved here. </p>

              <p>So what is the game about? A long time ago, humanity created robots with artificial intelligence that decided to go against humanity. Cylons, as they were called, fought a war against the race that created them and then left known part of the universe. No one heard of them or seen them for many years... until one day they decided to come back. They launched a surprise nuclear attack on all 12 human colonies. Core of the colonial fleet was destroyed in the first waves of the attack. One battlestar survived because it was scheduled for decommission and was not even part of the fleet when new war started. Galactica was put back into duty, restocked with ammunition and ready to fight. With dozens of Viper mark 2 fighters and brave pilots on-board, it gathered remaining civilian ships into a fleet and set on a voyage into the unknown part of the galaxy seeking refuge. This is where the storyline of the tv series starts.<br>
                  <br>
              You are thrown into pilot seat of a Viper Mark 2, colonial space fighter, one of many fighters carried by Galactica. Cylons just appeared on radar screens and you scramble to intercept them. You have to defend the fleet until our ships can spin their FTL (faster than light) drives and jump away to safety. At least that was the idea. In reality, the game was not playable. Enemy fighters were supposed to, you know, fight back. Instead they just flown in circles like stupid sheep. Boids implementation was a total disappointment. <br>
              <br>
              Few other things came out right. Steering the viper with a gamepad was as enjoyable as watching it on tv. Tight turns. Firing cannons. You can see that on the demonstration I recorded in the middle of the project lifetime. Just so you know, this is not the final demo of the game but it is my favorite, so please, enjoy it.
