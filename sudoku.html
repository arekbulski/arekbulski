              <p><b>Sudoku puzzles recognition and solving</b> is my Bachelor's thesis. I used a myriad of image processing techniques to automate analysis of images and extract information. You run the attached program on a laptop. Take a sudoku puzzle, like one of those printed in newspapers or puzzle books. Show it to the webcam. For example, here is one puzzle picture taken. </p>

              <p>Thresholding is the first phase. It means each pixel gets classified as either black or white. New threshold is computed for each pixel, independently, by averaging the neighboring pixels and adding some constant. This way, lights and shadows do not produce artifacts because borders need to significantly stand out from background no matter how bright or dark background is. </p>

              <p>Boldifying is the second phase. Pixels that are surrounded by several (many enough) black pixels get classified as black. This way both borders and some thin layer of pixels around borders turn black. </p>

              <p>Blob extraction is the third phase. Black pixels that are next to one another are grouped into components (or so called blobs). The component that has most pixels becomes the king of the hill and purges other components from the image. Only the biggest component remains in the end. </p>

              <p>Edges are found by using an adaptive probabilistic Hough transform, which for us just means, we put a grid of pixels in and get some geometric lines (segments) back. Unfortunately not only the four outer borders get tagged but also many other lines within the puzzle. So we take ends of all the lines and pick those that are closest to corners of the image. This is how we end up with four green-rectangles below.  </p>

              <p>Perspective reversal is the next phase. What you see on previous image is a projection of a rectangle onto a three dimensional flat surface. We need to stretch and twist the image so we end up with the puzzle spanning entire image. Once digits are uniformly spaced throughout the image they can be recognized using some sort of OCR or neural networks.  </p>

              <p>Once sudoku was numerically solved, new digits are applied in the same, uniformly spaced way onto a blank white image. These new digits will be merged with original image.
